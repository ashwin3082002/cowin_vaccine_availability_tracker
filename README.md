# cowin_vaccine_avaliability_tracker
A basic Python script that can show vaccine availability based on the pincode you enter. 

I have created a basic python script that can get info about the vaccine avalibilty in your area based on the pincode you enter, It can also show the details for upto 7 days based on your input

I am working on a GUI version of this Script to make the script more attractive and use friendly.

Fell free to email me at ashwin3082002@gmail.com if you have any doubts.
