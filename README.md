# cowin_vaccine_availability_tracker
A basic Python script that can show vaccine availability based on the pincode you enter. 

I have created a basic python script that can get info about the vaccine availability in your area based on the pincode you enter, It can also show the details for upto 7 days based on your input

I am working on a GUI version of this Script to make the script more attractive and use friendly.

Library used 
* Requests 
* Json
* datetime

This Script will give the following information:
* Pincode of the centre
* Date of the Vaccine
* Centre Name
* Number of vaccine's Available
* Vaccine Type
* Minimum Age limit
